1. GET the system

Approach

First, I tried the qemu build on vogon, but ultimately decided to run qemu on my mac. 

Problems Encountered

Building from source failed on my mac.


Solutions

So I downloaded the qemu gui applications "Q". 

Lessons Learned

Cross compiling open source software is not always as simple as ./configure && make && sudo make install 


2. LOGIN

Approach:

Type "root" at the prompt.

Problems:

none.

Solution:

none.

Learned:

Minix login is very similar to linux login.

3. MAKE USER

Approach:

Use the adduser utility.

Problems:

Didn't specify the group or directory.

Solution:

# adduser jason wheel /home/jason
# passwd jason
<enter password twice> 
# su jason

Learned:

That I had to specify a group and home directory for the user.


4. FLOPPY DISK

Approach:

Use the utilities provided by "Q" software.
Create a 1.44 Mb file on the host computer and set it to be the floppy device.

Problems:

I experienced many problems creating, mounting and using a floppy disk device
using qemu. Also, I ran into more problems with my keymap. For example '/' was
remapped to ?. Therefore I had to type SHIFT+/ to get the character '/'.

On the host machine I created a floppy image with 
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=./floppy.img bs=1024 count=1440

Then in qemu I added the flag '-fda ./floppy.img' to the arguments.

Though, while in the VM /dev listed many devices and partitions. For example,
there was all of the following:

/dev/fd0
/dev/fd0p1
/dev/fd0p2
/dev/fd0p3
/dev/fd1
/dev/fd1p1
/dev/fd1p2
/dev/fd1p3
/dev/fd2
/dev/fd2p1
/dev/fd2p2
/dev/fd2p3

When trying to mount a directory. This error occured.
# mkdir /mnt/floppy
# mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
mount: Can't mount /dev/fd0 on /mnt/floppy: Invalid Argument
*

The error was the same for each floppy disk block device. 

Solutions:
First, I needed to make a filesystem on the floppy device.
# mkfs /dev/fd0
Then mount the device
# mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
Though ultimately since I am using a Macintosh I am unable to mount the minix
filesystem. Thus, I will need to use the step 5 method to transfer data.

I was able to make sure the floppy image was written to by using the minls
method after copying the image to vogon. 

Learned:

There must be a valid filesystem to mount the drive. Otherwise, the mount
command will blow up.

5. THE DIRTY WAY

Approach:

I created a file named cats.txt in the method as follows. 
# cat > cats.txt
Hello this is sample text

wohooo!
^D
# tar cvf /dev/fd0 ./cats.txt

Then, on the host computer I was able to extract it by using this method.
$ tar xvf ./floppy.img
x ./cats.txt
jtdreisb@pcp067702pcs:os$ cat ./cats.txt 
Hello this is sample text

wohooo!
jtdreisb@pcp067702pcs:os$ 

Problems:

None.

Solution:
Explanation in the approach section.

Learned:

That the disk file can be written to represent a tar archive. Also, that
regular files may be written to look as if they were real block devices with
partition tables.
